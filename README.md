# Steering of AIs in video games, Unreal Engine 5.0.3

This project is a way to learn how to code different steering behaviours.
Thanks to UI, you can swicth between steering modes and see the differences between them.
Even if it's on Unreal, all the code about steering is in C++, not Blueprint.

# How to launch it

Once you've cloned the project, open it with Unreal and it will ask for a build of the sources.  
Normally, you will be able to open the project when the build is done.  
You'll also have access to the C++ files
